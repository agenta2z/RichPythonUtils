"""
Test Threading pattern with ThreadQueueService

This demonstrates how multiple threads can use the queue service
for inter-thread communication. ThreadQueueService works
well with threads since they share the same memory space.

Tests:
- Multiple producer threads putting items
- Multiple consumer threads getting items
- Thread-safe operations

Prerequisites:
    No external dependencies (uses standard library)

Usage:
    python test_threading.py
