Test Lock Mechanism for StorageBasedQueueService

Comprehensive tests specifically for the file locking mechanism:
- Concurrent access from multiple processes
- Lock contention scenarios
- Race condition prevention
- Lock timeout handling
- Lock acquisition/release correctness
- Simultaneous read/write operations
- Stress testing with high concurrency
