"""
The most efficient algorithm for permutation generation without considering lexicographical order is Heap's algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap%27s_algorithm,
We do not include it here as it is a very specialized algorithm.

Python has a build-in function `itertools.permutations` for permutation, and it is based on the same logic as `next_lexicographic_permutation` below.

    """
    Generate all permutations of a sequence using recursion.

    Args:
        seq (Sequence[T]): The sequence to generate permutations for.

    Yields:
        Generator[Sequence[T], None, None]: Each permutation as a sequence.

    Examples:
        >>> list(iter_permutation_recursive([1, 2, 3]))
        [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]

    Notes:
        - **Recursion**: all permutations can be grouped by its first element (to be exact the first element's index in the original input sequence).
          Once we fix the first element, tha group's permutations are permutations of remaining elements.

        - **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) for one permutation.
          There would be n recursive calls for one permutation, and at each call `seq[:i] + seq[i+1:]` takes O(n) time to create the sequence.

        - **Space Complexity**: O(n^2)
          The recursive call stack requires O(n) space, and concatenating slices of the sequence (e.g., `seq[:i] + seq[i+1:]`) at each level also requires O(n) space. Combined, this results in a total space complexity of O(n^2).

          Additionally, the generator itself does not hold all permutations in memory, making it more memory-efficient than returning a complete list of permutations.

    """
    Generates the next lexicographic permutation of a given sequence.

    The algorithm modifies the sequence to the next permutation in lexicographic order.
    If the sequence is the last permutation (sorted in descending order), the function returns the first permutation
    (sorted in ascending order). This algorithm uses an efficient in-place approach.

    Args:
        seq (Sequence[T]): The input sequence to find the next permutation.
        in_place (bool): If True, modifies the sequence in place. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        Sequence[T]: The next permutation in lexicographic order. If no further permutations exist,
        returns the first permutation in lexicographic order.

    Examples:
        Example 1: Sequence is in descending order
        >>> seq = [3, 2, 1]
        >>> next_lexicographic_permutation(seq)
        [1, 2, 3]

        Example 2: Regular case
        >>> seq = [1, 2, 3]
        >>> next_lexicographic_permutation(seq)
        [1, 3, 2]

        Example 3: Single element
        >>> seq = [1]
        >>> next_lexicographic_permutation(seq)
        [1]

        Example 4: Sequence with repeated elements
        >>> seq = [1, 2, 2]
        >>> next_lexicographic_permutation(seq)
        [2, 1, 2]

        Example 5: In-place modification
        >>> seq = [1, 2, 3]
        >>> next_lexicographic_permutation(seq, in_place=True)
        [1, 3, 2]
        >>> seq  # The original sequence is modified
        [1, 3, 2]

    Notes:
        - The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.
        - The space complexity is O(1) when `in_place=True`, as no additional data structures are used.
