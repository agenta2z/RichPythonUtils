def shortest_circular_path(graph: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """
    Solves the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using dynamic programming with bitmasking,
    utilizing a dictionary to store DP states to optimize space.

    Args:
        graph (List[List[int]]): A 2D list representing the distances between cities.
            - `graph[i][j]` is the cost to travel from city `i` to city `j`.
            - It is assumed that `graph[i][i] = 0` for all `i`.
            - The matrix should be square and of size `n x n`, where `n` is the number of cities.

    Returns:
        int: The minimal total cost to visit all cities exactly once and return to the starting city.

    Examples:
        >>> graph = [
        ...     [0, 10, 15, 20],
        ...     [10, 0, 35, 25],
        ...     [15, 35, 0, 30],
        ...     [20, 25, 30, 0]
        ... ]
        >>> shortest_circular_path(graph)
        80

        Explanation:
            The optimal tour is 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 0 with total cost 10 + 25 + 30 + 15 = 80.

    Notes:
        **Problem Statement**:
            - Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, find the shortest possible route
              that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

        **Dynamic Programming Approach with Dictionary**:
            - **State Representation**:
                - We represent the set of visited cities using a bitmask (integer).
                - Each city corresponds to a bit in the mask; if the bit is set, the city has been visited.
            - **DP Dictionary**:
                - We use a dictionary `dp` where each key is a tuple `(mask, u)`, and the value is the minimal cost to reach city `u` with visited cities represented by `mask`.
            - **Recursive Formula**:
                - For each city `u` and for each subset of cities `mask` that includes `u`:
                    ```python
                    dp[(mask, u)] = min(
                        dp[(prev_mask, v)] + graph[v][u]
                        for all v where v != u and (prev_mask, v) in dp
                    )
                    ```
                    - `prev_mask` is `mask` with the bit corresponding to city `u` turned off.
            - **Base Case**:
                - `dp[(1 << start, start)] = 0`, where `start` is the starting city (assumed to be city `0`).
            - **Final Answer**:
                - The minimal cost to complete the tour is:
                    ```python
                    min(dp[(full_mask, u)] + graph[u][start] for u in range(n) if u != start and (full_mask, u) in dp)
                    ```
                    - `full_mask` represents the set where all cities have been visited.

        **Advantages of Using a Dictionary**:
            - **Space Optimization**:
                - We only store the states that are actually computed.
                - This can save memory when many states are not reachable or can be pruned.
            - **Flexibility**:
                - Easier to implement pruning strategies and custom logic.

        **Time Complexity**:
            - **O(n^2 * 2^n)** in the worst case.
                - The number of states remains the same as before.
                - However, practical performance may improve due to reduced memory overhead and possible pruning.

        **Space Complexity**:
            - **O(n * 2^n)** in the worst case.
                - Using a dictionary does not change the theoretical space complexity, but it can reduce actual memory usage.

        **Constraints**:
            - The number of cities `n` should be at least `2`.
            - The graph must be symmetric if the distances are bidirectional.
            - All distances should be non-negative integers.
