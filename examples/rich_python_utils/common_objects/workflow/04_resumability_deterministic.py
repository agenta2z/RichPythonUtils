Example 4: Resumability — deterministic expansion via registry

Demonstrates: crash and resume a workflow that expanded mid-run.
The planner emitted 3 workers; we crash in the middle of them.
On resume the engine reconstructs the expanded step list (via a
registered factory keyed by expansion_id) and picks up from the
last-successful saved step.

This is the path to take when the planner's output is derived
from static / reproducible inputs (no LLM, no randomness).

Key insight: the planner step does NOT re-run on resume. Its
"decision" (how many workers to emit and which) is captured via
the expansion_id + the factory in `expansion_step_registry`.

Run: python 04_resumability_deterministic.py
