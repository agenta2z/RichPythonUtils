Example 5: Resumability — undeterministic expansion (LLM-driven) via seed

Demonstrates THE HEADLINE capability: a planner whose output comes from
an LLM (non-deterministic) can still be resumed — the LLM is invoked
EXACTLY ONCE across Run 1 + Run 2.

How: the planner returns an ExpansionResult with (seed, reconstruct_from_seed).
The seed is whatever non-deterministic value the planner committed to (here:
the LLM's output list). The reconstruct_from_seed factory is a module-level
function that, given the seed, returns the SAME step list deterministically.

Persistence path:
  Run 1: planner calls LLM → seed = [...], factory = _seed_factory
         seed + factory qualified name saved into checkpoint
  Run 2: resume loads seed, imports _seed_factory by name, calls it(seed)
         to get the step list. LLM is NOT re-invoked.
