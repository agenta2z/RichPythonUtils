"""
Monitor Pattern with Multiprocessing (run_async Router Mode)

This example demonstrates the queue-based monitor pattern using processes:
- A background process increments a counter in a file every 2 seconds
- A monitor task watches the file and triggers actions when count % 20 == 0
- Uses router mode (router=Callable) because closures can't cross process boundaries

Scenario:
    Same as the threading example, but using multiple processes for true parallelism.
    This is useful when monitor/action tasks are CPU-bound, or when you need
    isolation between tasks.

Key Concepts:
    - run_async() with router mode: tasks return just result, router decides next_tasks
    - Router runs in MAIN PROCESS: has access to graph logic, state dicts, closures
    - Only raw functions cross process boundary: must be picklable (no closures)
    - Self-loop pattern: router returns task pointing to same function

Why Router Mode for Multiprocessing?
    - Worker processes can only execute picklable functions
    - Closures capture local state -> not picklable
    - Router runs in main process -> CAN use closures and local state
    - This gives you the best of both worlds!

Key Takeaways:
- Router mode: tasks return just result, router decides next_tasks
- Router runs in MAIN PROCESS: can use closures and local state
- Task functions must be top-level (picklable for multiprocessing)
- Router pattern separates execution (workers) from orchestration (main)
- This enables complex workflows with true process isolation

When to use Router Mode:
- Multiprocessing (closures can't cross process boundaries)
- Complex routing logic that needs access to shared state
- When you want to keep orchestration logic centralized
- Integration with WorkGraph (router is auto-generated)
